## Lolcat Clock
Practise project idea from a skillcrush blog which lists ideas for JavaScript projects. 
I have written my own code from scratch as a challenge and used pictures of my cat! The design is fully responsive.

Credit to www.skillcrush.com for some great JS project ideas.

## Tech Used
**JavaScript CSS HTML**

## Purpose

A 12 hour clock which displays images dependant on different times set by defaults, or set by the user

## Features
* Responsive design accross all screen types
* 12 hour clock with AM and PM displayed, set to GMT
* User can select Wake-Up, Lunch, and Nap times using selectors, image changes accordingly
* Party Button activates party image. Button changes text and appearance accordingly
* Default times and images set for morning, afternoon, and evening

## Improvements and Edits
* Solved issues:
* 12 hour clock was showing -12 at midnight: added if statement to display 0
* Improved responsiveness for mobile

** Party Button issue:
  * If event listener has been triggered, party button does not activate. 
  Tried placing party button code higher up in the code to parse first, but didn't work. 
  Look into the issue and find a fix: possibly add a conditional statement
  
## Future Improvements and additions
** Add caption/quote on photos as `<span>` and change using JavaScript to make furture edits easier
** Add a "night mode" with sleeping night image, and darker colours
  * Night mode activated by a crescent moon shaped button, and for a set default time using JS
